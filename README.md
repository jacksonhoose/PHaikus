## PoopHaikus
I built Poophaikus.com sometime ~ 2010 when I first started getting into web development.  I'm trying to pick up some new node/javascript related technologies so I've decided to rebuild the site using Koa/Angular/MongoDB. 

### Setup
* install Mongodb and create a PoopHaikus DB with a Haikus collection
* run `npm install`
* run `node seed.js` to seed database
* run `node --harmony app.js` to start app
